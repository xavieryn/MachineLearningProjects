# MachineLearningProjects
Will be putting a bunch of random projects on here, so I can remember which ones I actually completed!

Note: Write what projects I did in the Readme file, so I can quickly go through what I learned and why it was important to me. 

Number Classification: Bottom of the barrel project, wanted to learn after doing most of Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng. I implemented a simple number classification using Keras. It was a pretty fast project as I had done something similar in the course, but it felt fulfilling because it was the first project that I had done which was fully mine. It was also a lot easier than I thought because I was actually implementing the equations in Andrew Ng's course, but here I just had a bunch of functions that did the work for me.
